# Natural Language Processing Tasks - Novice Level

Complete **ANY TWO** of the following tasks.

---

## Task 1: Text Preprocessing Pipeline

### Objective
Build a complete text preprocessing pipeline.

### Requirements
1. Implement the following preprocessing steps:
   - Convert text to lowercase
   - Remove punctuation and special characters
   - Tokenization (split into words)
   - Remove stopwords
   - Implement basic stemming or lemmatization
2. Create a function that applies all steps to input text
3. Test on sample texts and show before/after
4. Count word frequencies after preprocessing
5. Visualize the most common words

### Hints
- Use string methods and regular expressions
- Create a list of common stopwords or use a library
- Consider edge cases (numbers, special characters)

---

## Task 2: Simple Text Classifier

### Objective
Create a basic text classifier using simple techniques.

### Requirements
1. Choose a classification task (e.g., sentiment, topic)
2. Implement a bag-of-words representation
3. Build a simple classifier using:
   - Word frequency counts
   - Basic scoring mechanism
4. Test on at least 10 sample texts
5. Report accuracy and explain your approach

### Hints
- Start with binary classification (positive/negative)
- Use keyword-based or rule-based approach
- Consider word importance/weights

---

## Task 3: Text Similarity Analysis

### Objective
Implement methods to compare text similarity.

### Requirements
1. Implement at least 2 similarity metrics:
   - Jaccard similarity
   - Cosine similarity (using word counts)
2. Create functions for each metric
3. Test on pairs of sentences/documents
4. Visualize similarity scores
5. Discuss when each metric is most appropriate

### Hints
- Convert texts to sets or vectors
- Normalize scores to 0-1 range
- Test with varying degrees of similar texts

---

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Correctness**: Implementation produces expected results
- **Code Quality**: Clean, readable, well-commented code
- **Documentation**: Clear explanations of approach and results
- **Testing**: Demonstrates functionality with good examples
