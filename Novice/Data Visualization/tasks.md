# Data Visualization Tasks - Novice Level

Complete **ALL THREE** of the following tasks.

---

## Task 1: Basic Chart Types

### Objective
Create a variety of basic charts to visualize different types of data.

### Requirements
1. Create the following chart types:
   - Line chart (time series data)
   - Bar chart (categorical comparisons)
   - Scatter plot (relationship between variables)
   - Pie chart (proportions)
   - Histogram (distribution)
2. Use appropriate labels, titles, and legends
3. Apply proper formatting (colors, sizes, fonts)
4. Create at least one multi-panel figure
5. Save visualizations in high quality

### Hints
- Use matplotlib.pyplot as your base
- Consider using sample datasets or generate synthetic data
- Pay attention to readability
- Use color purposefully

## Task 2: Comparative Visualization

### Objective
Create visualizations that effectively compare multiple datasets or categories.

### Requirements
1. Create at least 3 comparative visualizations:
   - Side-by-side comparison
   - Overlaid comparison
   - Small multiples/faceted plots
2. Use a consistent dataset across visualizations
3. Demonstrate different comparison techniques
4. Add annotations to highlight key differences
5. Explain which visualization works best and why

### Hints
- Use subplots for side-by-side comparisons
- Consider transparency for overlays
- Keep scales consistent for fair comparison
- Highlight important findings

## Task 3: Interactive Dashboard Design

### Objective
Design a simple dashboard to present multiple insights.

### Requirements
1. Create a dashboard layout with 4-6 visualizations
2. Include different chart types showing related data
3. Organize visualizations logically
4. Add a title and brief descriptions for each chart
5. Ensure consistent styling across all charts
6. Document the story your dashboard tells

### Hints
- Use matplotlib subplots or a grid layout
- Think about visual hierarchy
- Group related visualizations
- Consider the flow of information
- Add summary statistics as text
