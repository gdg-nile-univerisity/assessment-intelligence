# General Machine Learning Tasks - Novice Level

Complete **ANY TWO** of the following tasks.

---

## Task 1: Linear Regression from Scratch

### Objective
Implement linear regression using gradient descent.

### Requirements
1. Implement linear regression with:
   - Cost function (MSE)
   - Gradient descent optimization
   - Training loop
2. Generate or use a simple dataset
3. Train your model and visualize:
   - Cost vs iterations
   - Fitted line vs actual data
4. Calculate R² score
5. Document your implementation

### Hints
- Start with a single feature
- Use appropriate learning rate
- Monitor convergence
- Use numpy for matrix operations

## Task 2: K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier

### Objective
Build a KNN classifier from scratch.

### Requirements
1. Implement KNN algorithm with:
   - Distance calculation (Euclidean)
   - K-neighbor selection
   - Majority voting for classification
2. Test on a simple 2D classification problem
3. Experiment with different K values
4. Visualize decision boundaries
5. Report accuracy for each K value

### Hints
- Start with small K values (3, 5, 7)
- Use numpy for efficient distance computation
- Consider handling ties in voting
- Visualize data points and predictions

## Task 3: Data Preprocessing and Analysis

### Objective
Implement essential data preprocessing techniques.

### Requirements
1. Implement the following preprocessing methods:
   - Feature scaling (normalization and standardization)
   - Handling missing values
   - Train-test split
2. Apply to a sample dataset
3. Show statistics before and after preprocessing
4. Explain when to use each technique
5. Demonstrate impact on a simple model

### Hints
- Create synthetic data with various issues
- Calculate mean, std, min, max before/after
- Compare model performance with/without preprocessing
- Document best practices
