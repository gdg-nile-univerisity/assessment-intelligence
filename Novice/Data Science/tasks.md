# Data Science Tasks - Novice Level

Complete **ANY TWO** of the following tasks.

---

## Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis

### Objective
Perform comprehensive exploratory data analysis on a dataset.

### Requirements
1. Load a dataset (CSV or create synthetic data)
2. Perform the following analyses:
   - Calculate basic statistics (mean, median, std, etc.)
   - Identify missing values and outliers
   - Analyze distributions of key variables
   - Find correlations between features
3. Create at least 5 different visualizations
4. Document insights and patterns discovered
5. Suggest data quality improvements

### Hints
- Use pandas for data manipulation
- Create histograms, scatter plots, box plots
- Consider data types and ranges
- Look for interesting relationships

## Task 2: Simple Predictive Model

### Objective
Build a basic predictive model for a real-world problem.

### Requirements
1. Choose a prediction task (e.g., price, category)
2. Prepare your data:
   - Handle missing values
   - Encode categorical variables
   - Split into train/test sets
3. Build a simple model (linear regression or decision tree)
4. Evaluate performance with appropriate metrics
5. Interpret results and model predictions

### Hints
- Start with a small dataset
- Use simple models first
- Document your feature engineering choices
- Explain model predictions

## Task 3: Feature Engineering and Analysis

### Objective
Create and analyze features for improving predictions.

### Requirements
1. Start with a raw dataset
2. Create at least 5 new features:
   - Derived features (ratios, differences)
   - Aggregated features
   - Transformed features (log, polynomial)
3. Analyze feature importance/correlation
4. Compare model performance with/without new features
5. Document your feature engineering process

### Hints
- Think about domain-specific features
- Test feature combinations
- Use visualization to understand features
- Consider feature scaling
