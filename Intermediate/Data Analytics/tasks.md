   - Define hypothesis
   - Determine sample size requirements
   - Set significance level and power
2. Generate or use experimental data
3. Perform statistical analysis:
   - T-test or Z-test for continuous metrics
   - Chi-square test for categorical metrics
   - Calculate confidence intervals
4. Check assumptions:
   - Normality tests
   - Variance equality
   - Sample independence
5. Handle multiple metrics and variants
6. Calculate business impact:
   - Expected lift
   - Revenue impact
   - Risk assessment
7. Provide actionable recommendation
8. Create executive summary with visualizations

### Hints
- Use proper statistical tests for your data
- Consider practical significance vs statistical significance
- Account for multiple testing if needed

   - User characteristics
   - Acquisition channel
3. Calculate metrics:
   - Retention rates by cohort
   - Cohort lifetime value
   - Engagement metrics
   - Churn patterns
4. Create visualizations:
   - Cohort retention heatmap
   - Cohort comparison charts
   - Trend analysis
