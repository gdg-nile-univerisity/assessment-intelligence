# Data Visualization Tasks - Intermediate Level

Complete **ALL THREE** of the following tasks.

---

## Task 1: Multi-Dimensional Data Visualization

### Objective
Create visualizations that effectively display high-dimensional data.

### Requirements
1. Use a dataset with 5+ features
2. Create at least 5 different multi-dimensional visualizations:
   - Parallel coordinates plot
   - Heatmap with hierarchical clustering
   - 3D scatter plot with multiple encodings
   - Faceted/small multiples visualization
   - Bubble chart with size and color encoding
3. Implement dimensionality reduction visualization:
   - PCA or t-SNE projection
   - Color by category or continuous variable
4. Add interactive elements where appropriate
5. Document insights from each visualization
6. Explain when each visualization type is most effective

### Hints
- Use plotly for 3D and interactive plots
- Consider color schemes for continuous vs categorical
- Add proper legends and annotations
- Balance information density with clarity

## Task 2: Interactive Dashboard

### Objective
Build an interactive dashboard for exploring a dataset.

### Requirements
1. Choose a comprehensive dataset
2. Create an interactive dashboard with:
   - Multiple linked visualizations (4-6 charts)
   - Interactive filtering/selection
   - Dynamic updates across views
   - Summary statistics display
3. Include diverse chart types:
   - Time series plots
   - Distribution plots
   - Categorical comparisons
   - Relationship/correlation plots
4. Implement interactivity:
   - Hover tooltips
   - Click selection
   - Range sliders or dropdowns
5. Professional styling and layout
6. Export or save capability

### Hints
- Use plotly Dash, Streamlit, or ipywidgets
- Start with layout design
- Test interactivity thoroughly
- Consider mobile/responsive design

## Task 3: Data Storytelling with Visualizations

### Objective
Create a narrative presentation using visualizations to tell a data story.

### Requirements
1. Choose a dataset with an interesting story
2. Develop a narrative structure:
   - Introduction/context
   - Rising action (exploration)
   - Climax (key insight)
   - Resolution (conclusions)
3. Create 6-8 visualizations that support the narrative
4. Use progressive disclosure:
   - Start simple, add complexity
   - Build on previous insights
   - Guide viewer attention
5. Include:
   - Annotations highlighting key points
   - Consistent visual theme
   - Clear transitions between sections
6. Write accompanying text explaining the story
7. Create a compelling conclusion with recommendations

### Hints
- Think like a journalist
- Use visual hierarchy effectively
- Highlight before showing full data
- Connect visualizations logically
- Consider emotional impact
