# Nile GDSC Core Ai Application Entry Repository

This is the repository for the Nile GDSC Core Ai application entry. Please make sure to read below before proceeding.

## Overview

This repository contains AI/ML and Data tasks at three difficulty levels:

### Novice Level

Tasks designed for beginners to AI/ML, focusing on fundamental concepts and practical implementations.

### Intermediate Level

Tasks designed for those with foundational knowledge in AI/ML. Each domain contains 3 tasks covering core concepts.

### Pro Level

Advanced tasks for experienced practitioners, featuring complex challenges and real-world applications.

All levels include tasks in seven domains:

- **Computer Vision** - Image processing, object detection, and segmentation
- **Deep Learning** - Neural networks, transfer learning, and regularization
- **Natural Language Processing** - Text classification, NER, and text generation
- **General Machine Learning** - Classification, regression, and clustering fundamentals
- **Data Science** - Predictive modeling, feature engineering, and business analytics
- **Data Visualization** - Interactive dashboards, multi-dimensional visualizations, and insights
- **Data Analytics** - Statistical analysis, cohort analysis, and optimization

## Getting Started

1. **Choose your level**: Navigate to `Novice/`, `Intermediate/`, or `Pro/` folder
2. **Select a domain**: Choose from any of the seven domains available
3. **Read the instructions**: Review the `README.md` and `tasks.md` in your chosen folder
4. **Complete the tasks**:
   - **AI/ML domains** (CV, DL, NLP, General ML): Complete **ANY TWO task**
   - **Data Science & Data Analytics**: Complete **ANY TWO tasks**
   - **Data Visualization**: Complete **ALL THREE tasks**
